# react-3d-project

We are developing a web application focused on sustainable fashion. The project involves creating an interactive 3D website where users can navigate a virtual store and learn about what makes fashion sustainable. During this process, the development will include creating an immersive, user-friendly interface that allows users to explore a virtual store, making navigation intuitive and engaging to enhance the user experience. The project requires the creation and integration of high-quality 3D models of clothing and accessories, ensuring they are detailed and optimized for web performance to enable quick load times and smooth interactions. Utilizing advanced web technologies such as Three.js, these 3D models will be rendered directly in the browser, mastering shaders, lighting, and material properties to create a realistic virtual environment. Interactive features will be implemented, allowing users to interact with 3D models through rotating, zooming, and viewing detailed information, applying principles of user experience (UX) design. The application will run efficiently across various devices and browsers by optimizing 3D models for performance, managing assets effectively, and implementing lazy loading techniques.

We are using React, Node.js, and Three.js for this project.
